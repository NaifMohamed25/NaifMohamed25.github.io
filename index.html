    <h2>📜 1. Early Beginnings of Hacking</h2>
    <p>
        The origins of hacking stretch far before the development of modern computers. 
        In the 1950s and 1960s, the term “hacker” was first used at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) 
        to describe highly skilled programmers who enjoyed experimenting with systems and pushing machines beyond their designed limits. 
        These early hackers were passionate problem-solvers, not criminals.
    </p>

    <h3>🔹 Phone Phreaking (1960s – 1970s)</h3>
    <p>
        Before digital computers became widespread, hacking started with the telephone system. 
        Phone “phreakers” discovered that they could manipulate tones to make free long-distance calls. 
        The most famous among them, <b>John Draper</b>, also known as “Captain Crunch,” 
        used a whistle from a cereal box to generate perfect frequencies for phone system control.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
        <b>Fun Fact:</b> Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs (founders of Apple) built and sold “blue boxes” used for hacking phone networks.

    <h2>💻 2. The Rise of Computer Hacking (1970s – 1980s)</h2>
    <p>
        With the invention of personal computers, hacking moved from telephones to digital systems. 
        Many young enthusiasts explored early networks such as ARPANET (the predecessor to the Internet), 
        often breaking into university systems simply to learn how they worked.
    </p>

    <h3>🔹 Notable Early Hacker Groups</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The 414s</b> – One of the first well-known hacking groups, infiltrated high-profile systems such as Los Alamos National Laboratory (1983).</li>
        <li><b>Legion of Doom</b> – Influential U.S. hacking group focused on learning and sharing advanced techniques.</li>
        <li><b>Chaos Computer Club (CCC)</b> – Founded in Germany (1981), became one of the most respected ethical hacker collectives.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box">
        <b>Impact:</b> These hacking incidents led governments to pass the first-ever computer crime laws.

    <h2>🕶️ 3. The 1990s — The Hacker Golden Age</h2>
    <p>
        During the 1990s, the Internet became publicly accessible, creating a massive playground for hackers. 
        This decade saw both legendary criminal hackers and the birth of modern cybersecurity.
    </p>

    <h3>🔹 Famous Hackers of the 1990s</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Kevin Mitnick</b> – Considered the “World’s Most Wanted Hacker”; hacked Motorola, Nokia, and the U.S. government.</li>
        <li><b>Kevin Poulsen</b> – Hijacked phone lines to win a radio contest.</li>
        <li><b>Robert Tappan Morris</b> – Released the first major Internet worm (Morris Worm, 1988).</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box">
        <b>Did You Know?</b> Mitnick later became an ethical hacker and founded a cybersecurity company.

    <h2>⚠️ 4. The Modern Era (2000s – Present)</h2>
    <p>
        The rise of smartphones, cloud computing, and global interconnected systems gave hackers more targets than ever. 
        Today, hacking includes both criminal activity and ethical cybersecurity operations.
    </p>

    <h3>🔹 Modern Types of Hackers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Black Hat Hackers</b> – Malicious attackers who exploit systems for profit or damage.</li>
        <li><b>White Hat Hackers</b> – Ethical hackers who identify vulnerabilities to improve security.</li>
        <li><b>Grey Hat Hackers</b> – Operate in the middle; break systems without permission but not always with harmful intent.</li>
        <li><b>State-Sponsored Hackers</b> – Work for governments; target critical infrastructure and foreign systems.</li>
    </ul>
